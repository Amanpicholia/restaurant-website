# Restaurant-Website
MERN_STACK PROJECT

# Restaurant Website

This is a full-stack web application for a restaurant, built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The frontend is developed using React.js to provide an interactive user interface, while the backend is implemented with Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and interact with a MongoDB database to collect user details from customers.

## Features

- **Interactive Frontend**: The frontend of the website is built using React.js to provide a dynamic and user-friendly interface for customers to browse menu items, make reservations, and interact with the website.
- **User Authentication**: Customers can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts. This allows for personalized experiences such as saving favorite menu items, viewing order history, and receiving promotions.
- **Menu Management**: Admin users can manage menu items, including adding new items, updating existing items, and removing items from the menu.
- **Reservation System**: Customers can make reservations through the website, providing details such as date, time, number of guests, and special requests.
- **Contact Form**: A contact form is available for customers to send inquiries, feedback, or special requests directly to the restaurant.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin users have access to a dashboard where they can view reservation details, manage menu items, and respond to customer inquiries.
